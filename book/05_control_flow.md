## **Chapter 5: Control Flow and Conditionals**

So far, our scripts have been linear. They execute from the inside out, following a single, predetermined path. To build truly dynamic transformations, we need the ability to make decisions. We need to be able to say: "If this condition is met, do this; otherwise, do that."

This is the role of the `if` operator in Computo.

### The `if` Operator

The `if` operator is the primary tool for conditional logic in Computo. Its structure is simple and should be familiar from other programming languages.

`["if", <condition>, <then_expression>, <else_expression>]`

The engine evaluates the `<condition>` expression first.
*   If the result is "truthy", the engine evaluates and returns the result of the `<then_expression>`.
*   If the result is "falsy", the engine evaluates and returns the result of the `<else_expression>`.

A crucial feature of `if` is **lazy evaluation**: only the branch that is chosen gets evaluated. The other branch is completely ignored, which is important for both performance and preventing errors.

### Computo's Definition of "Truthy" and "Falsy"

Since JSON has several data types, Computo has clear rules for what it considers `true` or `false` in a conditional context. These rules are very similar to those in languages like Python or JavaScript.

| Value Type | Falsy (evaluates to `false`) | Truthy (evaluates to `true`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Boolean** | `false` | `true` |
| **Number** | `0` and `0.0` | Any non-zero number |
| **String** | The empty string `""` | Any non-empty string |
| **Object** | The empty object `{}` | Any object with one or more keys |
| **Array** | The empty array `[]` or `{"array": []}` | Any array with one or more elements |
| **Null** | `null` | (never truthy) |

### Example: Conditional Greeting

Let's build a script that generates a different output based on whether a user is active.

1.  We'll start with a new `input.json` containing a list of users.

    **`users_input.json`:**
    ```json
    {
      "users": [
        { "name": "Alice", "active": true, "plan": "premium" },
        { "name": "Bob", "active": false, "plan": "basic" },
        { "name": "Charlie", "active": true, "plan": "basic" }
      ]
    }
    ```

2.  Now, let's write a script to process a single user. We'll use `let` to grab the first user from the array for simplicity.

    **`conditional_user.json`:**
    ```json
    ["let",
      [
        ["user", ["get", ["$input"], "/users/0"]]
      ],
      ["if",
        ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/active"],
        { "status": "Welcome!", "user_data": ["$", "/user"] },
        { "status": "Access Denied", "reason": "User is inactive" }
      ]
    ]
    ```

3.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    computo conditional_user.json users_input.json
    ```

The output will be:
```json
{
  "status": "Welcome!",
  "user_data": {
    "active": true,
    "name": "Alice",
    "plan": "premium"
  }
}
```
Because the `active` field for the first user (`Alice`) is `true`, the `then_expression` was evaluated and returned.

Now, change the `get` expression to select the second user, Bob: `["get", ["$input"], "/users/1"]`. Run the script again.

The output now reflects the `else_expression`:
```json
{
  "reason": "User is inactive",
  "status": "Access Denied"
}
```

### Pattern: Conditional Templating

The real power of `if` emerges when you combine it with `permuto.apply`. You can use Computo's logic to select the correct Permuto template based on input data.

Let's create two different Permuto templates.

**`active_user_template.json`:**
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome back, ${/name}!",
  "dashboard_url": "/dashboard",
  "plan": "${/plan}"
}
```

**`inactive_user_template.json`:**
```json
{
  "message": "Your account for ${/name} is inactive.",
  "reactivation_url": "/reactivate-account"
}
```

Now, we can write a script that uses `if` to choose which template to apply.

**`template_selector.json`:**
```json
["let",
  [
    ["user", ["get", ["$input"], "/users/0"]]
  ],
  ["if",
    ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/active"],
    ["permuto.apply",
      {
        "message": "Welcome back, ${/name}!",
        "dashboard_url": "/dashboard",
        "plan": "${/plan}"
      },
      ["$", "/user"]
    ],
    ["permuto.apply",
      {
        "message": "Your account for ${/name} is inactive.",
        "reactivation_url": "/reactivate-account"
      },
      ["$", "/user"]
    ]
  ]
]
```

Run this script (with the `--interpolation` flag to handle the strings):

```bash
computo --interpolation template_selector.json users_input.json
```

**Output for Alice (user 0):**
```json
{
  "dashboard_url": "/dashboard",
  "message": "Welcome back, Alice!",
  "plan": "premium"
}
```

**Output for Bob (if you change the script to user 1):**
```json
{
  "message": "Your account for Bob is inactive.",
  "reactivation_url": "/reactivate-account"
}
```

This pattern is incredibly powerful. Your application logic remains clean; it simply executes a Computo script. The complex conditional templating logic is entirely self-contained within the script data itself.

### Logical Operators: `&&` and `||`

For more complex conditional logic, Computo provides logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators. These operators support **short-circuit evaluation**, meaning they stop evaluating as soon as the result is determined.

#### The `&&` (Logical AND) Operator

The `&&` operator returns `true` only if **all** of its arguments are truthy. It evaluates arguments from left to right and stops as soon as it encounters a falsy value.

`["&&", <expr1>, <expr2>, <expr3>, ...]`

**Examples:**
```json
// All conditions must be true
["&&", true, [">", 10, 5], ["!=", "hello", ""]]
// Result: true (all are truthy)

// Short-circuit evaluation - stops at first falsy value
["&&", false, ["/", 1, 0]]
// Result: false (division never evaluated, preventing error)

// Practical example: user validation
["&&", 
  ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/active"],
  [">", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/age"], 18],
  ["!=", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/status"], "banned"]
]
```

#### The `||` (Logical OR) Operator

The `||` operator returns `true` if **any** of its arguments are truthy. It evaluates arguments from left to right and stops as soon as it encounters a truthy value.

`["||", <expr1>, <expr2>, <expr3>, ...]`

**Examples:**
```json
// Any condition can be true
["||", false, ["==", 2, 2], ["!=", "a", "a"]]
// Result: true (stops at second argument)

// Practical example: role checking
["||", 
  ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/role"], "admin"],
  ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/role"], "moderator"],
  ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/role"], "owner"]
]
```

#### Combining Logical Operators with `if`

These operators are particularly powerful when used as conditions in `if` statements:

**`advanced_user_check.json`:**
```json
["let",
  [
    ["user", ["get", ["$input"], "/users/0"]]
  ],
  ["if",
    ["&&",
      ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/active"],
      ["||",
        ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/plan"], "premium"],
        [">", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/credits"], 100]
      ]
    ],
    { 
      "access": "granted", 
      "level": "full",
      "user": ["$", "/user"]
    },
    { 
      "access": "denied", 
      "reason": "User must be active and either premium or have 100+ credits"
    }
  ]
]
```

This script grants full access only if:
1. The user is active AND
2. The user has either a premium plan OR more than 100 credits

The logical operators make complex business rules much more readable than nested `if` statements.

#### Short-Circuit Evaluation Benefits

Short-circuit evaluation provides two key benefits:

1. **Performance**: Unnecessary computations are avoided
2. **Safety**: Potentially error-causing expressions aren't evaluated

```json
// Safe division check
["&&", ["!=", ["$", "/divisor"], 0], [">", ["/", ["$", "/dividend"], ["$", "/divisor"]], 10]]
// If divisor is 0, division is never attempted

// Safe array access
["&&", [">", ["count", ["$", "/items"]], 0], ["!=", ["get", ["$", "/items"], "/0/status"], "deleted"]]
// If array is empty, array access is never attempted
```

### Approximate Equality: The `approx` Operator

When working with floating-point numbers, exact equality comparisons can be problematic due to precision issues. The `approx` operator provides a solution for comparing numbers within a specified tolerance.

`["approx", <number1>, <number2>, <epsilon>]`

The `approx` operator returns `true` if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than or equal to the epsilon value.

#### Basic Floating-Point Comparison

**Example: Comparing calculated values**

```json
[
  /* Compare a calculated result with an expected value */
  "approx", 
  ["/", 22, 7],        /* 22/7 = 3.142857... */
  3.14159,             /* Expected Ï€ approximation */
  0.01                 /* Tolerance of 0.01 */
]
```

**Output:** `true` (because the difference is less than 0.01)

#### Practical Use Cases

**`temperature_comparison.json`:**
```json
["let",
  [
    ["sensor1_temp", 23.456],
    ["sensor2_temp", 23.461],
    ["tolerance", 0.01]
  ],
  ["obj",
    /* Check if sensor readings are approximately equal */
    ["sensors_match", [
      "approx", 
      ["$", "/sensor1_temp"], 
      ["$", "/sensor2_temp"], 
      ["$", "/tolerance"]
    ]],
    
    /* Traditional exact comparison would likely fail */
    ["exact_match", [
      "==", 
      ["$", "/sensor1_temp"], 
      ["$", "/sensor2_temp"]
    ]],
    
    ["difference", [
      "-", 
      ["$", "/sensor2_temp"], 
      ["$", "/sensor1_temp"]
    ]]
  ]
]
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "sensors_match": true,
  "exact_match": false,
  "difference": 0.005
}
```

#### Financial Calculations

Approximate equality is particularly useful in financial calculations where rounding errors are common:

**`budget_validation.json`:**
```json
["let",
  [
    /* Calculate total from individual items */
    ["calculated_total", [
      "+", 
      ["+", 19.99, 24.95], 
      ["*", 1.08, 44.94]  /* Add 8% tax */
    ]],
    
    /* Expected total from external system */
    ["expected_total", 48.53],
    
    /* Penny tolerance for financial calculations */
    ["penny_tolerance", 0.01]
  ],
  ["obj",
    ["totals_match", [
      "approx",
      ["$", "/calculated_total"],
      ["$", "/expected_total"], 
      ["$", "/penny_tolerance"]
    ]],
    ["calculated", ["$", "/calculated_total"]],
    ["expected", ["$", "/expected_total"]]
  ]
]
```

#### Combining with Conditional Logic

The `approx` operator works seamlessly with `if` and logical operators:

**`quality_control.json`:**
```json
["let",
  [
    ["measured_weight", 10.003],
    ["target_weight", 10.0],
    ["tolerance", 0.005]
  ],
  ["if",
    ["approx", 
      ["$", "/measured_weight"], 
      ["$", "/target_weight"], 
      ["$", "/tolerance"]
    ],
    {
      "status": "PASS",
      "message": "Weight within acceptable tolerance"
    },
    ["obj",
      ["status", "FAIL"],
      ["message", "Weight exceeds tolerance"],
      ["deviation", [
        "-", 
        ["$", "/measured_weight"], 
        ["$", "/target_weight"]
      ]]
    ]
  ]
]
```

**Why Not Regular Comparison?**

Consider this problematic scenario without `approx`:

```json
/* This might unexpectedly return false due to floating-point precision */
["==", ["/", 1, 3], 0.3333333333333333]

/* This is more reliable for floating-point comparisons */
["approx", ["/", 1, 3], 0.3333333333333333, 0.0001]
```

The `approx` operator provides a robust solution for real-world applications where perfect precision isn't possible or necessary.

### Logical NOT: The `not` Operator

Sometimes you need to negate a boolean value or invert the truthiness of an expression. The `not` operator provides this functionality.

`["not", <expression>]`

The `not` operator evaluates its argument and returns the logical opposite:
- If the argument is truthy, `not` returns `false`
- If the argument is falsy, `not` returns `true`

**Examples:**

```json
// Basic boolean negation
["not", true]        // Result: false
["not", false]       // Result: true

// Negating comparison results
["not", [">", 5, 10]]    // Result: true (because 5 > 10 is false)
["not", ["==", "a", "a"]] // Result: false (because "a" == "a" is true)
```

#### Practical Use Cases

**Checking for empty collections:**

```json
// Check if an array is NOT empty
["not", ["==", ["count", ["$", "/items"]], 0]]

// Check if a string is NOT empty  
["not", ["==", ["$", "/message"], ""]]

// Check if an object is NOT empty
["not", ["==", ["$", "/config"], {}]]
```

**Inverting complex conditions:**

```json
["let",
  [
    ["user", ["get", ["$input"], "/user"]]
  ],
  ["if",
    ["not", 
      ["&&",
        ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/active"],
        [">=", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/age"], 18]
      ]
    ],
    {
      "access": "denied",
      "reason": "User must be active and 18 or older"
    },
    {
      "access": "granted",
      "user_data": ["$", "/user"]
    }
  ]
]
```

This script denies access if the user is NOT (active AND 18+), which is equivalent to saying the user is either inactive OR under 18.

#### Understanding Truthiness with `not`

The `not` operator follows Computo's truthiness rules:

```json
// These evaluate to true (because the inputs are falsy)
["not", 0]           // true (0 is falsy)
["not", ""]          // true (empty string is falsy)
["not", []]          // true (empty array is falsy)
["not", {}]          // true (empty object is falsy)
["not", null]        // true (null is falsy)

// These evaluate to false (because the inputs are truthy)
["not", 42]          // false (non-zero number is truthy)
["not", "hello"]     // false (non-empty string is truthy)
["not", {"a": 1}]    // false (non-empty object is truthy)
```

#### Combining `not` with Other Logical Operators

The `not` operator works well with other logical operators to create complex expressions:

```json
// Check if user is NOT an admin AND NOT a moderator
["&&",
  ["not", ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/role"], "admin"]],
  ["not", ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/role"], "moderator"]]
]

// Alternative using De Morgan's law - this is equivalent to the above
["not", 
  ["||",
    ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/role"], "admin"],
    ["==", ["get", ["$", "/user"], "/role"], "moderator"]
  ]
]
```

**Validation example:**

```json
["let",
  [
    ["email", ["get", ["$input"], "/email"]],
    ["password", ["get", ["$input"], "/password"]]
  ],
  ["if",
    ["||",
      ["not", ["$", "/email"]],           // Email is falsy (missing/empty)
      ["not", ["$", "/password"]],        // Password is falsy (missing/empty)
      ["<", ["count", ["$", "/password"]], 8]  // Password too short
    ],
    {
      "valid": false,
      "error": "Email and password are required, password must be 8+ characters"
    },
    {
      "valid": true,
      "message": "Credentials accepted"
    }
  ]
]
```
