2. Appendix B: CLI Reference (immediate practical value)
3. Appendix C: Complete Examples Index (high user demand)
4. Appendix E: Troubleshooting Guide (essential for users)

### Medium Priority (Valuable additions)
1. Appendix D: Integration Patterns
2. Appendix F: JSON Pointer Reference
3. Performance enhancements to Chapter 12
4. Error handling improvements to Chapter 13

### Lower Priority (Nice to have)
1. Appendix G: Thread Safety Guide
2. Appendix H: Performance Benchmarks
3. Appendix I: Migration Guide
4. Appendix J: Advanced Development

## Notes
- The existing chapters 12-15 are already quite comprehensive and well-written
- Focus should be on creating practical appendices that provide immediate value
- The CLI reference and troubleshooting guide will likely be the most frequently accessed
- Examples index should be organized by use case rather than by operator
- All new content should maintain the same high-quality, practical focus as existing chapters
